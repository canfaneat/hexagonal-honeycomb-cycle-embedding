The existence and construction of cycles of various lengths in an interconnection network are important
issues in efficiently executing ring-structured parallel algorithms in such a network. The hexagonal
honeycomb mesh (HHM) is regarded as a promising candidate for interconnection networks. In this
paper we address the problem of how to embed even-length cycles in an HHM. We prove that an HHM
of order t ≥ 3 admits a cycle of length l for each even number l such that l = 6 or 10 ≤ l ≤ 6t2 − 2.
We also describe a systematic method for building these cycles.

1. Introduction
It is well known that many classical parallel algorithms possess a ring-structured task graph. In
order to implement a ring-structured parallel algorithm efficiently on a specific multicomputer
system, it is essential to map the tasks owned by the parallel algorithm to the nodes of the
underlying interconnection network so that any two tasks that are adjacent in the ring are
mapped to two adjacent nodes of the network [1]. If the number of tasks in the ring-structured
parallel algorithm equals the number of nodes in the associated interconnection network, it is
desirable for this network to have a Hamiltonian cycle (i.e. a cycle which passes every node
of the network). In real situations, a ring-structured parallel algorithm with few tasks is often
executed on an interconnection network with a larger number of nodes (this is especially the
case for coarse-grained parallel algorithms), and efficient mapping demands that the network
admit a cycle of some given length. An interconnection network which possesses cycles of
various lengths is preferred for this purpose.
Stojmenovic [2] proposed two types of honeycomb structure as candidates for intercon-
nection networks: the honeycomb mesh and the honeycomb torus. An important advantage

of honeycomb networks over their mesh/torus counterparts is that the number of links per
node is restricted to two or three, which can significantly decrease the complexity of their
hardware implementation. Because of this attractive feature, honeycomb networks and their
generalizations have received considerable attention [3–16].
Although the cycle-embedding capabilities of honeycomb torus networks and their gener-
alizations have been studied intensively [6,7,9,12], these networks are difficult to implement
in VLSI layout [2]. In contrast, the asymmetric honeycomb mesh can easily be implemented
on a single board, which makes it a more appealing choice from the practical viewpoint [14].
Although a hexagonal honeycomb mesh (HHM) of order t ≥ 2 is not Hamiltonian, its cycle-
embedding capability is still worth studying, as indicated previously. To our knowledge, no
such investigation has been reported in the literature.
In this paper we address the existence of cycles of various lengths in an HHM. We prove
that an HHM of order t ≥ 3 admits a length-l cycle for each even number l such that l = 6 or 
10 ≤ l ≤ 6t2 − 2. A systematic method for building these cycles is also presented. The result
obtained partially justifies the utility of HHM.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the definition of
hexagonal honeycomb mesh, and describes a node-labelling scheme and a cycle-labelling
scheme. Section 3 establishes the result. Finally, some conclusions are presented in section 4.
2. Preliminaries
For fundamental graph-theoretical terminologies the reader is referred to [17]. For a cycle C
in a graph, let E(C) denote the set of all the edges on C. An l-cycle is a cycle of length l.
Given two sets S1 and S2, we let S1 ⊕ S2 = (S1 − S2 ) ∪ (S2 − S1).
DEFINITION 1 A hexagonal honeycomb mesh (HHM) of order t is defined recursively as
follows:
(i) An HHM of order 1 is a 6-cycle drawn on the plane as shown in figure 1(a).
(ii) For t ≥ 2, an HHM of order t is a graph obtained by adding a set of 6(t − 1) 6-cycles
around the border of an HHM of order t − 1 in an edge-sharing manner ( figures 1(b)–
1(d)).
An HHM of order t has a total of 6t2 nodes and 9t2 − 3t edges. Figure 1 shows four small
HHMs.
We now introduce some notation to enable us to label a node or a 6-cycle in an HHM.
DEFINITION 2 Consider a 6-cycle in an HHM. The node that is on the north (south, northeast,
southeast, northwest, southwest) corner of the 6-cycle is referred to as the N-node (S-node,
NE-node, SE-node, NW-node, SW-node) of this 6-cycle ( figure 2).
DEFINITION 3 Consider an HHM of order t ≥ 2. A 6-cycle that is on the boundary of the
HHM is referred to as a B cycle of the HHM.
(i) The B cycle of the HHM that is on the east (west, northeast, southeast, northwest,
southwest) corner of the HHM is referred to as the E-B cycle (W-B cycle, NE-B cycle,
SE-B cycle, NW-B cycle, SW-B cycle) of the HHM.
(ii) The rth B cycle of the HHM when counting in order from the NE-B cycle to the E-B cycle
( from the SE-B cycle to the E-B cycle, from the NW-B cycle to theW-B cycle, from the SW-B
cycle to the W-B cycle, from the NE-B cycle to the NW-B cycle, from the SE-B cycle to

the SW-B cycle) of the HHM is referred to as the NE-E(r)-B cycle (SE-E(r)-B cycle,
NW-W(r)-B cycle, SW-W(r)-B cycle, NE-NW(r)-B cycle, SE-SW(r)-B cycle) of the HHM.
Figure 3 illustrates the terminologies introduced in Definition 3.
DEFINITION 4 Consider an HHM of order t and an integer s where 1 ≤ s ≤ t. The HHM of
order s that is at the centre of the original HHM is referred to as the central sub-HHM of
order s of the original HHM (see figure 4 for an illustration).

Using the notation defined above, it is easy to label a node or a 6-cycle in an HHM. For
example, in figure 5 the shaded 6-cycle is labelled as the NW-B cycle of the central sub-HHM
of order 2, and the encircled node is labelled as the NW-node on this 6-cycle.
3. Main result
The following facts are obvious.
• An HHM does not contain any cycles of odd length because it is a bipartite graph.
• An HHM does not admit any cycles of length 6t2 because it is not a Hamiltonian graph.
• An HHM has a 6-cycle.
• An HHM has neither a 4-cycle nor an 8-cycle.
The following question now arises: For any given even number l with 10 ≤ l ≤ 6t2 − 2,
does an HHM of order t contain a cycle of length l? We now answer this question.
THEOREM 1 Consider an HHM of order t ≥ 3. Let l be an even number with 10 ≤ l ≤ 6t2 − 2.
Then the HHM contains a cycle of length l.
Proof Clearly, the HHM contains a 10-cycle. Next, let us assume that 12 ≤ l ≤ 6t2 − 2. We
need to examine four possible cases with respect to the value of l.
Case 1 l = 6 t2 – 2. Look at two nodes: the NW-node on the NW-W(2)-B cycle of the HHM
and the SW-node on the W-B cycle of the central sub-HHM of order 2. It can be seen
that the graph obtained by deleting these two nodes from the HHM contains a unique
Hamiltonian cycle ( figure 6), which is a cycle of length 6t2 – 2 of the original HHM.
Case 2 l = 6t2 − 4k − 2, where k is an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 1.5t2 − 3.5 (equivalently, 12 ≤
l ≤ 6t2 − 6 and 6t2 − l ≡ 2 (mod 4)). We distinguish between two possibilities of the
parity of t.
Case 2.1 t is even. Let C denote the cycle described in case 1, and let E = E(C). Let
C1, C 2 , . . . , C k denote the first to kth 6-cycles when counting in the order
determined by the set of arrows shown in figure 7. For i from 1 to k, we 
let E = E ⊕ E(Ci). When this procedure has been completed, a cycle of
length 6t2 − 4k − 2 is obtained.
Case 2.2 t is odd. Let C denote the cycle given in case 1, and let E = E(C). Let C0
denote the central 6-cycle of the HHM. Let C1, C 2 , . . . , C k−1 denote the
first to (k − 1)th 6-cycles when counting in the order determined by the set
of arrows shown in figure 8. For i from 0 to k − 1, we let E = E ⊕ E(Ci).
When this procedure has been completed, a cycle of length 6t2 − 4k − 2 is 
obtained.
Case 3 l = 6t2 − 4. We proceed by considering the parity of t.
Case 3.1 t is odd. Look at four nodes: the NW-node on the NW-W(2)-B cycle of the
HHM, and the N-node, the NW-node, and the SW-node on the W-B cycle
of the central sub-HHM of order 3. It can be seen that the graph obtained
by deleting these four nodes from the HHM contains a unique Hamiltonian
cycle ( figure 9), which is a cycle of length 6t2 – 4 of the original HHM.
Case 3.2 t is even. Look at four nodes: the N-node and the NW-node on the NW-B
cycle of the HHM, the S-node on the NW-W(2)-B cycle of the HHM, and
the SW-node on the W-B cycle of the central sub-HHM of order 2. It can
be seen that the graph obtained by deleting these four nodes from the HHM

contains a unique Hamiltonian cycle ( figure 10), which is a cycle of length
6t2 − 4 of the original HHM.
Case 4 l = 6t2 − 4k − 4, where k is an integer with 1 ≤ k ≤ 1.5t2 − 4 (equivalently, 12 ≤
l ≤ 6t2 − 8 and 6t2 − l ≡ 0 (mod 4)). Again, we need to consider the parity of t.
Case 4.1 t is odd. Let C denote the cycle presented in case 3.1, and let E = E(C). Let C1,
C2, ..., Ck denote the first to kth 6-cycles when counting in the order determined
by the set of arrows shown in figure 11. For i from 1 to k, we let E = E ⊕ E(Ci).
On completion of this procedure, a cycle of length 6t2 − 4k − 4 is formed.
Case 4.2 t is even. Let C denote the cycle given in case 3.2, and let E = E(C). Let C1, C2,
..., Ck denote the first to kth 6-cycles when counting in the order determined by
the set of outer arrows followed by the set of inner arrows shown in figure 12. For
i from 1 to k, we let E = E ⊕ E(Ci). When this procedure has been completed,
a cycle of length 6t2 − 4k − 4 is formed.
This completes the proof of Theorem 1. 
For completeness and by brute force, we obtain the following theorem.

THEOREM 2 An HHM of order 2 admits a cycle of length l ∈ { 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22}, and
admits no cycle of length 20.
4. Conclusions
The existence of cycles of various lengths in an interconnection network is an important
issue in evaluating how well a ring-structured parallel algorithm can be implemented on
this network. The hexagonal honeycomb mesh is a promising candidate for interconnec-
tion networks. In this paper we have proved that a hexagonal honeycomb mesh possesses a
cycle that has as length any value within a broad range. A systematic method for building
these cycles has also been presented. The result obtained justifies the utility of this type of
honeycomb mesh.
In future work we will extend the method used in this paper to establish similar results
for other types of honeycomb network such as the rectangular honeycomb mesh and the
parallelogramic honeycomb mesh [2].
